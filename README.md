# Kaggle 5 Days of AI Agents – Completed

This repository contains my completed work for **Kaggle's 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course**, created in collaboration with Google’s ML researchers and engineers.  
The program provides a hands-on introduction to building modern AI agents using tools, orchestration, memory, and evaluation techniques.

## About the Course
The course covers:
- ✔️ Foundations of AI agents  
- ✔️ Using models effectively  
- ✔️ Integrating tools into agents  
- ✔️ Memory and state management  
- ✔️ Evaluation and improvement of agent systems  
- ✔️ Deploying production-ready agent solutions  

Each day includes exercises, coding tasks, and practical projects that progressively build toward real-world agent workflows.

## What I Learned
- Building structured agent pipelines  
- Implementing tool-using agents  
- Managing agent memory and context  
- Evaluating agent responses with automated metrics  
- Designing agents for reliability and scalability
